# SkillsApp
##This is a web application used for students in NYU join programs/workshops/events held by offices of campus.

This application is developed by [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) platform.
I use MySQL as my database instead of MongoDB, which built in Meteor. The driver package I used is from [Nodets](https://github.com/nodets/meteor-mysql).
